                                The main objective of scheduling is to allocate processor time in such a way as to optimize one or more aspects of system behavior.
                                Mainly the focus is on effective and efficient utilization of the processor. An example is throughput, which is the rate at which processes are completed.
                                This is certainly a worthwhile measure of system performance and one that we would like to maximize. System oriented objectives for scheduling algorithms
                                are throughput, processor utilization, fairness, enforcing priorities, balancing resources. <br />

                                            with FCFS is to use preemption based on a clock. The simplest such policy is Round
